    "By the end of the tutorial, we had code to get all of the books, along with their price, rating, and a link to their dedicated page.\n",
    "\n",
    "My next challenge for you is to do the following\n",
    "\n",
    "1. On each of the dedicated pages, there is a description of the book. Write code that will scrape the description for each book and add it as a column on the product_info dataframe.\n",
    "2. Currently, this scraper can only access the first page of results. Modify the scraper so that it iterates through pages. (Hint: There is a link close to the bottom of each page, but the title will be different each time (page-3, page-4, etc.). You will need to work in a solution that finds the link each time, or automatically increments the page at each iteration."
