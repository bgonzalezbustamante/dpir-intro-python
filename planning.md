# Course Outline

## Week 1: Introduction to Programming with Python

The first week is aimed at answering basic and practical questions social scientists with no background in programming will have when first engaging with Python. Although it is possible to begin programming without understanding these concepts, having this grounding will reduce confusion in the future, and give students a better idea of "what am I looking at?"

We start with some very general points about programming and development, and then focus on answering the question _what can I do with Python_? Ultimately, as social scientists we will use Python and other programming languages more _users_ than _developers_, so understanding what these tools are useful for comes before what understanding what these tools _are_.

<!-- Thought -->

Can structure one section of the slides:

- What can I do with this (tool)?
- What is this (tool)?
- How do I use this (tool)?

<!-- End of Thought -->

### Learning Aims:

- What will learning Python allow me to do?
    - Data Proficiency
        - Storage
        - Conversion
        - Merging
        - Cleaning
    - Data Visualisation
        - Static
        - Dynamic
    - Machine Learning
        - Supervised
        - Unsupervised
    - Automation
        - Web Scraping
- Why Python and not `R`?
    - Great deal of overlap in functionality.
    - `R` is primarily a statistics-focused language, Python is general-purpose.
    - Ideally be comfortable with both: there are a lot of cutting-edge tools that are only implemented in one language and not the other.
- To introduce students to essential programming skills and concepts, including:
    - Programming language vs software
        - What is the shell/terminal?
        - What goes on when we execute a command?
        - What goes on when we execute a program?
    - Code editors
        - Jupyter
        - Spyder
        - PyCharm
        - Atom, etc.
    - Environments
        - What is a library?
        - Installing Python, managing environments with Conda
    - Bonus topic: Git, Github and collaborative development

### Skill Aims:


<!-- Old Syllabus -->

# What are common political science applications for Python?

- Data Cleaning (pandas)
- Data Visualisation (matplotlib and seaborn)
- Machine Learning (scikit-learn)
- Web Scraping (BeautifulSoup)

# Current Description

Students have the option of taking an 8-week introduction to Python. Each session will consist of a 1-hour lecture and a 1-hour workshop. Students are required to bring their own laptop to class. Guidance will be provided in the first week to set up their computing environment (e.g. installing Python software). After taking this course, students should be able to write small to medium-scale Python projects that help them in their daily research. We shall be using Python 3. The course will cover the basics of the Python programming language, followed by guiding the students to develop their own Python application to do web scraping and simple data analysis. The primary reference text for the course will be the book Automate the Boring Stuff with Python by Al Sweigart.

# Revised Description

Students have the option of taking an 8-week intensive introduction to Python. Each session will consist of a 1-hour lecture and a 2-hour workshop.
Students are required to bring their own laptop to class, and will be given guidance on how to set up their programming environment prior to the first lesson.
After covering the fundamentals of writing your first scripts in Python, the course will cover key topics for social science researchers, including working with and visualising data, fitting your first machine learning algorithms, and collecting data from the web. The course will be fast-paced, intensive, and by the end students will have the skills to begin implementing computational methods in their own work.
