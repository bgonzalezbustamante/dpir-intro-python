<p>This is an work-in-progress website to accompany the Intro Python course held at the DPIR in Hilary Term 2020. For now, this page will just remain an index for other files in this course.</p>
<h2 id="lecture-slides">Lecture Slides</h2>
<p>Iâ€™m experimenting with <a href="https://revealjs.com/#/"><code>reveal.js</code></a> for the lecture slides. To view the slides as I will be using them in the lectures, follow the <em>slides</em> links below. If you would prefer the pdf version, follow the <em>pdf</em> links below.</p>
<p>Please be aware, lectures will be updated continuously, and may contain errors.</p>
